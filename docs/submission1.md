# Benefits of Signed Commits
Signed commits ensure the authenticity and integrity of changes in a repository. 
By signing a commit, developers verify that the commit came from a trusted source and hasn't been altered. 
This is particularly useful in collaborative environments and public repositories where identifying the author is essential. 
It also helps to build trust and accountability within teams by proving that each commit belongs to a legitimate team member.

# Merge Strategies in Git
- **Standard Merge**: Combines two branches by creating a merge commit. This retains the entire commit history of the merged branches.
  - **Pros**: Retains history, useful for debugging.
  - **Cons**: Can clutter history with too many merge commits.

- **Squash and Merge**: Combines all feature branch commits into a single commit.
  - **Pros**: Keeps main branch history clean.
  - **Cons**: Loses granular commit history from the feature branch.

- **Rebase and Merge**: Reapplies commits from a feature branch onto the base branch.
  - **Pros**: Creates a linear history.
  - **Cons**: Alters commit history, which can cause confusion or conflicts.

**Standard Merge is often preferred** because it maintains a complete and accurate record of the projectâ€™s development, making it easier to trace issues and understand changes.
