Legend to explain criteria:
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Indicates whether the registry provides built-in security scanning to detect vulnerabilities in artifacts.

- **Geo-Replication**: Describes whether the registry supports automatic replication of artifacts across different geographic regions.

- **Access Control**: The system used to manage and restrict access to the registry and its contents.

- **External Repositories**: Refers to whether the registry supports connecting to external sources to fetch dependencies.

- **Lifecycle Management**: Describes whether the registry provides features to automate the cleanup of old or unused artifacts.

---
## Summary

- **Amazon ECR** and **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** focus mainly on managing Docker container images with features like geo-replication, image scanning, and integration with their respective cloud CI/CD services.
- **AWS CodeArtifact** and **Azure Artifacts** are more suitable for managing multiple package formats (npm, Maven, NuGet, PyPI) and are well-integrated with their respective DevOps tools. They are ideal for organizations managing various package dependencies.
- **GCP Artifact Registry** provides a unified platform supporting both container images and multiple package formats, making it versatile and efficient for hybrid use cases.

## Summary

- **AWS** (Amazon Web Services): Offers three primary serverless platforms â€” **AWS Lambda** for event-driven compute, **AWS App Runner** for containerized web applications, and **AWS Fargate** for containerized apps and tasks, all of which integrate seamlessly into AWS services.
  
- **Google Cloud**: Provides **Google Cloud Run** for running containerized apps, and **Google Cloud Functions** for event-driven functions, both of which scale automatically and are deeply integrated with Google's ecosystem.

- **Microsoft Azure**: Delivers **Azure Container Apps** and **Azure Container Instances** for containerized workloads. **Azure Container Apps** is particularly suited for microservices.
