**Signing commits is a security practice in Git.**

The most common commit signing techniques include ***SSH, GPG, and S/MIME.***
They are primarily used for authorship verification, allowing contributors to verify the authorship of commits (prove that the commit were indeed made by them).  

Sign tags or commits that are marked as verified assure others that the changes come from a trusted source. 


This practice is especially beneficial since it enforces: 

1. **Trustable integrity assurance**

A signed commit guarantess that since you made a commit, no one can modify it (if someone tries to alter a signed commit, the signature will become invalid).  


2. **Compliance with security policies**
   
This is important in industrial and commercial projects with strict security standards.

3. **Improved collaboration**
   
This is crucial, for example, in open-source and collaborative projects.
