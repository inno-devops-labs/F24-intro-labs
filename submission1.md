# Why signing commits matters.

## Authentication and Verification
When you sign a commit, you're using your own digital signature to verify that the changes you're making are actually coming from you. This makes your collaborators trust that the code they're working with is genuine and hasn't been tampered with.

## Accountability
Signed commits provide a clear audit trail, making it easier to track changes and identify who made them. This is especially important in open-source projects or large teams where multiple people are contributing to the codebase.

## Prevention of Malicious Activity
By signing your commits, you're making it much harder for malicious actors to introduce bad code or impersonate you. This adds an extra layer of security to your project and helps prevent attacks.

# Comparing merge strategies.

## Standard Merge
A standard merge creates a new merge commit that ties together the histories of the two branches being merged. This commit has two parent commits, one from each branch.

### Pros:

- Preserves the commit history of both branches
- Easy to track changes and identify who made them
- Works well in collaborative environments
### Cons:

- Can create a complex commit history
- May lead to merge conflicts

##  Squash and Merge
A squash and merge combines all the commits from the feature branch into a single commit, which is then merged into the main branch.

### Pros:

- Simplifies the commit history
- Reduces the number of commits in the main branch
- Easy to review changes
### Cons:

- Loses the individual commit history of the feature branch
- Can make it harder to track changes and identify who made them

## Rebase and Merge
A rebase and merge reapplies the commits from the feature branch onto the main branch, creating a linear commit history.

### Pros:

- Creates a linear commit history
- Reduces the number of merge conflicts
- Easy to review changes
### Cons:

- Rewrites the commit history, which can be problematic in collaborative environments
- May lead to conflicts when pushing changes to a shared repository

In collaborative environments, the standard merge strategy is often preferred because it preserves the commit history of both branches. This makes it easier to track changes, identify who made them, and resolve conflicts. Additionally, standard merge commits provide a clear audit trail, which is essential for accountability and transparency.
