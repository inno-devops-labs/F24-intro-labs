# Why signing commits matters.

## Authentication and Verification
When you sign a commit, you're using your own digital signature to verify that the changes you're making are actually coming from you. This makes your collaborators trust that the code they're working with is genuine and hasn't been tampered with.

## Accountability
Signed commits provide a clear audit trail, making it easier to track changes and identify who made them. This is especially important in open-source projects or large teams where multiple people are contributing to the codebase.

## Prevention of Malicious Activity
By signing your commits, you're making it much harder for malicious actors to introduce bad code or impersonate you. This adds an extra layer of security to your project and helps prevent attacks.
