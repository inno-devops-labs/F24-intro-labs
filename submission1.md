# Benefits of signing commits

Signing commits improves the **code's security** and has **several benefits**:

1) **Trust and reputation**: Signing commits gives others confidence that the modifications were indeed made by the author of the commit. This verification is essential to preserving trust and reputation, particularly in case someone tries to exploit the author's identity fraudulently to insert dangerous code.
2) **Local storage of key**: GitHub is unable to sign commits on behalf of users because it lacks access to the committer's private signing keys. The security of commits is enhanced since only the author has access to the signing key by keeping it locally.
