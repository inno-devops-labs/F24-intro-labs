# Task 1: Create GitHub Actions Pipeline

1) I have created `.github/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml` file in the root directory of the repository.
2) Filled in the config provided in the tutorial
```
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions 🚀
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "🎉 The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "🐧 This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "🔎 The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "💡 The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "🖥️ The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "🍏 This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

This GitHub Actions workflow triggers on a push event and runs on an Ubuntu server. It checks out the repository code, 
displays information about the event, runner, branch, and repository, lists the repository files, and reports the job's status.
