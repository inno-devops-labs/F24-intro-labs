## Task 1: Create Your First GitHub Actions Pipeline

### 1. **Read the Official Guide**: 
#### 1. Key concepts:
- Events - triggers for the workflow;
- Job - executes on a runner machine and run a series of one or more steps;
- Step - individual task that can run commands (a written script or an existing action);

Events can be triggered by:
- Events inside the repository (push, pull request, issue, etc.);
- External events (webhooks, scheduled events, etc.);
- Manual triggers;
- Scheduled events.

Workflow syntax is defined with help of YAML files.

Additionally, in a workflow can be used advanced features like:
- Secrets - encrypted environment variables;
- Creating dependent jobs;
- Using a matrix to run a job in multiple configurations;
- Caching dependencies and build outputs;
- Using databases or service containers.

#### 2. Steps I have followed to run a demo workflow:
   - 1. I have created a file .github/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml in my repository and added the example code to it.
   - 2. I have pushed the changes to the repository and observed the GitHub Actions workflow execution.
   
   
### 2. **Observe the Workflow Execution**:
Firstly, we can observe the success of the pipeline in the commits section of the repository:

![img.png](data/9_img.png)

Secondly, we can observe the status of the pipeline in the Actions section of the repository:
![img_1.png](data/9_img_1.png)
Here are created jobs for the pipeline:
![img_2.png](data/9_img_2.png)
Here are the logs of the job:
![img_3.png](data/9_img_3.png)

By looking at the workflow file, we can see that it is a simple workflow that runs on the push event for the main branch. 
It has a single job that prints a messages to the console, checks out the repository code, lists the files in the repository, and prints the final workflow status.


## Task 2: Gathering System Information and Manual Triggering

1. **Configure a Manual Trigger**:
 - I have added a new triger to the workflow tag 'on': 'workflow_dispatch'.
As it was stated in documentation, this trigger will work only if the workflow file is in the default branch.
 - I have merged the branch lab9 into master and a button to trigger the workflow appeared in the Actions section of the repository.

We can also choose the branch from which we want to run the workflow:
![img_5.png](data/9_img_5.png)

2. **Gather System Information**:
 - I have added a new step to the workflow that prints the system information with name "Gather System Information".
At the start of the step several runner environment variables are printed, such as runner name, runner os, image version.
Then, the following commands are executed:
   - `uname -a` - prints system information;
   - `lscpu` - prints information about the CPU architecture;
   - `free -m` - prints information about memory usage;
   - `df -h` - prints information about disk space usage.
 - The output of the step is shown in the logs of the job:
![img_6.png](data/9_img_6.png)

The whole output of Gathering System Information step:
